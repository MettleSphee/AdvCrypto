# AdvCrypto

Some algorithms from the Advanced Cryptography course, implemented with steps using Python 3.10+

The main usage would be to solve some of the problems given during said course.

They aren't complete and I'll be updating them whenever.

The steps are in an amalgam of RO/EN, but should still be a healthy step by step indicator.

Does NOT include Extended Euclid / Inverse Euclid

Requires Python 3.10+
